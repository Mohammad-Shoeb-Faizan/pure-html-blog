    <p>Naruto is a Japanese manga film based on teenage ninja Naruto Uzumaki, who attempts to become his villageâ€™s leader (Hokage). The drive to become Hokage leads him to seek recognition among his peers. This effort is, however, hampered by a demon (Kyuubi) that was sealed inside the boy before his birth.The story of Naruto is split into two; his early adolescent years, and the other part covers his teenage years when he strives to become a Hokage. This anime series previously existed in the print version but was adapted as a TV series in 2002. It ran for 220 episodes between 2002-and 2007 in Japan and later from 2005-to 2009 on Cartoon Network. Masashi Kishimoto wrote Naruto.</p>
